    "**tobac** is a Python package to rapidly identify, track and analyze clouds and storms in different types of gridded datasets, such as 3D model output from cloud-resolving model simulations or 2D data from satellite retrievals. This cookbook shows a workflow for how to track storms based on **unstructured model data** as unstructured grids become more and more common with the increasing spatial resolution of global weather and climate models. \n"

    "**tobac** has **four main modules**, so tracking can be done in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are detected in every time step using thresholds for a given atmospheric field and a minimum area that needs to be above or below this threshold. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Tracking \n",
    "    \n",
    "The detected features from step 1 are  linked over time using a search radius and their predicted propagation speed. In contrast to area-overlapping methods for the linking of features, **tobac** is based on particle tracking principles where the center points of features are assigned to a common track when they fall within the predicted radius of motion.\n",

Segmentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The merging and splitting module in tobac is an independent post-processing step that can be performed optionally after the linking of features into time-continuous storm tracks. Connectivity trees are used to identify potential mergers and splitters based on the information of both the individual features and their associated tracks present at a single time step."
